# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

## Overview

Welcome to OctoAcme's project management documentation. This collection of guides describes our structured, customer-focused approach to delivering projects across the organization. OctoAcme employs a repeatable, iterative methodology that emphasizes clear ownership, data-informed decisions, and psychological safety. Our processes are designed to ensure predictable delivery while maintaining high quality standards and fostering continuous improvement.

At the core of our approach is a well-defined project lifecycle that moves through distinct phases: **Initiation** (validating the business need and aligning stakeholders), **Planning** (breaking work into shippable increments and managing dependencies), **Execution** (building and testing iteratively with daily tracking), **Release & Deployment** (standardized deployment procedures with rollback plans), and **Retrospective** (capturing learnings and driving improvements). Each phase has specific deliverables, decision gates, and quality checks to ensure teams stay aligned and deliver value consistently.

OctoAcme defines clear roles and responsibilities for every project. **Project Managers** coordinate delivery, manage risks, and maintain transparency across stakeholders. **Product Managers** define what should be built, prioritize the roadmap, and measure outcomes. **Developers** implement features that meet acceptance criteria while maintaining code quality and test coverage. **QA/Testing** validates quality standards, and **Stakeholders** provide critical inputs and approvals. This role clarity ensures accountability and smooth collaboration throughout the project lifecycle.

Communication and quality assurance are woven throughout our processes. Teams follow established rhythms including daily standups, twice-weekly delivery syncs, weekly PM/PdM alignments, and monthly stakeholder updates. Quality is maintained through comprehensive testing strategies (unit, integration, and end-to-end tests), automated CI pipelines with security scanning, code review requirements, and standardized deployment checklists. Risk management is continuous, with risks identified early, assessed regularly, and mitigated proactively. This disciplined approach enables OctoAcme to deliver reliably while adapting quickly to changing requirements.
