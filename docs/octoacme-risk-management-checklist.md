# OctoAcme Risk Management Process Checklist

## Purpose
Guide Risk Owners through systematic risk identification, assessment, mitigation, and monitoring to proactively manage project risks and enable informed decision-making.

---

## Phase 1: Risk Identification

### Initial Risk Discovery (Project Kickoff)
- [ ] Review project charter and objectives for inherent risks
- [ ] Conduct risk brainstorming session with project team
- [ ] Review similar past projects for common risk patterns
- [ ] Identify technical, resource, schedule, and external risks
- [ ] Document risks in the Risk Register

### Ongoing Risk Identification (Throughout Project)
- [ ] Monitor project activities for emerging risks
- [ ] Review risks during weekly project syncs
- [ ] Solicit risk input from team members and stakeholders
- [ ] Track dependency changes that may introduce new risks
- [ ] Update Risk Register with newly identified risks

### Common Risk Categories to Consider
- [ ] Technical risks (architecture, scalability, integration)
- [ ] Resource risks (availability, expertise, turnover)
- [ ] Schedule risks (dependencies, estimates, scope creep)
- [ ] External risks (vendor dependencies, regulatory changes)
- [ ] Quality risks (test coverage, defect rates, technical debt)
- [ ] Security risks (vulnerabilities, compliance, data protection)

---

## Phase 2: Risk Assessment

### For Each Identified Risk
- [ ] Assign unique Risk ID for tracking
- [ ] Document clear risk description
- [ ] Assess Impact (High/Medium/Low)
  - High: Critical project failure or major business impact
  - Medium: Significant delay or quality degradation
  - Low: Minor impact, manageable within normal processes
- [ ] Assess Likelihood (High/Medium/Low)
  - High: Likely to occur (>50% probability)
  - Medium: Possible (20-50% probability)
  - Low: Unlikely (<20% probability)
- [ ] Calculate Risk Priority (Impact × Likelihood)
- [ ] Assign Risk Owner (individual accountable for monitoring)

### Risk Prioritization
- [ ] Rank risks by priority (High-High first, Low-Low last)
- [ ] Identify top 3-5 risks requiring immediate attention
- [ ] Review prioritization with Project Manager
- [ ] Present high-priority risks to Executive Sponsor (if needed)

---

## Phase 3: Risk Mitigation Planning

### For Each High-Priority Risk
- [ ] Develop specific mitigation actions to reduce likelihood or impact
- [ ] Assign responsible parties for mitigation actions
- [ ] Set target dates for mitigation implementation
- [ ] Estimate resources required for mitigation
- [ ] Document contingency plan if risk materializes

### Mitigation Strategy Options
- [ ] **Avoid:** Change plans to eliminate the risk entirely
- [ ] **Mitigate:** Take actions to reduce likelihood or impact
- [ ] **Transfer:** Shift risk to third party (insurance, vendor)
- [ ] **Accept:** Acknowledge risk and prepare response plan
- [ ] Document chosen strategy and rationale

### Review & Approval
- [ ] Review mitigation plans with Project Manager
- [ ] Validate technical mitigations with Development and QA teams
- [ ] Confirm resource availability for mitigation actions
- [ ] Get Executive Sponsor approval for high-cost mitigations
- [ ] Update Risk Register with mitigation plans

---

## Phase 4: Risk Monitoring & Control

### Weekly Risk Reviews
- [ ] Review status of all active risks
- [ ] Update risk likelihood and impact based on current state
- [ ] Track progress on mitigation actions
- [ ] Identify risks that have been realized or can be closed
- [ ] Add new risks identified during the week

### Risk Status Updates
- [ ] Update Risk Register with current status for each risk
  - Open: Risk is active and being monitored
  - Mitigated: Actions taken, risk reduced to acceptable level
  - Realized: Risk has occurred, response plan activated
  - Closed: Risk no longer relevant or project phase completed
- [ ] Document status changes and rationale

### Communication
- [ ] Include risk updates in weekly status reports
- [ ] Escalate new high-priority risks to Project Manager immediately
- [ ] Brief stakeholders on risk trends and major changes
- [ ] Present risk dashboard in project status meetings

---

## Phase 5: Risk Response (When Risks Materialize)

### Immediate Response
- [ ] Confirm risk has materialized and assess actual impact
- [ ] Activate contingency plan documented in Risk Register
- [ ] Notify Project Manager and affected stakeholders immediately
- [ ] Assign response team and establish command structure

### Issue Management
- [ ] Create incident ticket or issue for tracking
- [ ] Coordinate response activities with Project Manager
- [ ] Monitor response effectiveness and adjust as needed
- [ ] Document actions taken and outcomes

### Post-Response
- [ ] Conduct lessons learned review
- [ ] Update Risk Register with actual impact and response effectiveness
- [ ] Identify process improvements to prevent recurrence
- [ ] Share findings with broader organization

---

## Phase 6: Risk Reporting

### Weekly Status Report
- [ ] Summary of risk register changes (new, closed, updated)
- [ ] Top 3-5 risks with current status and mitigation progress
- [ ] Risks requiring decisions or escalation
- [ ] Risk trend analysis (improving, stable, worsening)

### Monthly Executive Summary
- [ ] Overall risk profile (count by priority level)
- [ ] Key risks and mitigation strategies
- [ ] Risks requiring executive attention or resources
- [ ] Risk metrics and trends over time

### End-of-Project Risk Report
- [ ] Summary of all risks tracked during project
- [ ] Effectiveness of risk management approach
- [ ] Lessons learned for future risk management
- [ ] Recommendations for organizational risk practices

## Risk Register Template

Use this template to track risks in your project documentation or tracking system:

| Risk ID | Description | Category | Impact | Likelihood | Priority | Owner | Mitigation Plan | Status | Last Updated |
|---------|-------------|----------|--------|------------|----------|-------|-----------------|--------|--------------|
| R-001 | Example risk description | Technical | High | Medium | High | Name | Actions to reduce risk | Open | YYYY-MM-DD |

### Risk Register Fields
- **Risk ID:** Unique identifier (e.g., R-001, R-002)
- **Description:** Clear statement of the risk and potential consequences
- **Category:** Technical, Resource, Schedule, External, Quality, Security
- **Impact:** High/Medium/Low
- **Likelihood:** High/Medium/Low
- **Priority:** Calculated from Impact × Likelihood
- **Owner:** Individual responsible for monitoring and mitigation
- **Mitigation Plan:** Actions to reduce likelihood or impact
- **Status:** Open, Mitigated, Realized, Closed
- **Last Updated:** Date of most recent status update

## Tips for Effective Risk Management
- Start risk identification early and continue throughout the project
- Don't just focus on technical risks—consider people, process, and external factors
- Be specific in risk descriptions—vague risks lead to ineffective mitigation
- Regularly reassess risks as project conditions change
- Celebrate risk management successes to reinforce the practice
- Document risk patterns to improve future project planning
